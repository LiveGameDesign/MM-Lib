# Micro-Machinations Library (MM-Lib)

## Introduction

The Micro-Machinations (MM) library enables game designers to modify economic game mechanics while a game is running.
More information will be provided as it becomes available.

| Directory | Platform  | Description |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| [mm/mm](https://github.com/vrozen/MM-Lib/tree/master/mm/mm)       | C++ | The MM library currently requires [STL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library), [Flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net) and [Bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/). |
| [mm/LibMM](https://github.com/vrozen/MM-Lib/tree/master/mm/LibMM) | C++ .NET | Wraps the MM library for usage with Microsoft .NET |
| [mm/tests](https://github.com/vrozen/MM-Lib/tree/master/mm/tests) | MM | Contains textual Micro-Machinations examples |

### Building MM

#### MacOS
* For MacOS we provide the XCode project *mm.xcodeproj*.
* Flex and Bison are part of XCode, the scanner and the parser are regenerated automatically.

#### Windows
* For Windows we provide the Visual Studio 2010 *LibMM* wrapper project.
* Flex and Bison are not required, precompiled sources of the scanner and parser are included.

### Reading about MM

We provide links to selected publications about the Machinations language. Machinations was originally only intended for game design [1] and has evolved into Micro-Machinations [2,3] which is also intended for software development.

## Changelog

### April 14th 2014 (v0.10):
Status:
* Made MM available under 3-clause BSD license.
* Successfully applied MM in the AdapTower game prototype and demonstrated live mods at the Foundations of Digital Games (FDG) conference.

Next steps:
* Testing
  * regression test setup
  * reuse examples used to test MM-AiR
* Evaluator: add features
  * gate
* Machine: manage all instances
  * maps and vectors
* Simplify external API as done with AdapTower C# wrapper.
* Documentation
  * DoxyGen
  * Architecture, design decisions

### Februari 14th 2014 (v0.01):
Status:
* Evaluator
  * Pool, Source, Drain, Flow edge, Trigger and Condition are working
  * Converters: seem to be working.
  * RefNodes and Aliases: seem to be working.
* Instance Pools
  * new feature that allows pools of objects (they do not flow between pools)
* Reflector: working, transforms types
  * add and replace work okay
  * update is still tricky
* Instances: observes definitions
* Declarations: observe definitions create InterfaceNodes, edges are resolved to these nodes
* Machine: tracks objects it owns
* Parser / Grammar: flex/bison working
  * Includes type transformations using "modify" keyword
  * Includes data transformations using "step" keyword
  * Identifiers are lexicals that are post-processed
  * Grammar has zero conflicts
